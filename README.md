This project was created as part of my coursework for my User Interface Design and Evaluation module in my second year of university.

I created this project using React - instructions on how to run the project can be found below:

1. Install Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en
2. Download the project and open it in an IDE (I used IntelliJ, but any will do).
3. Open a terminal in your IDE and make sure you are in the same directory that the project is stored in.
4. Run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies in the project.
5. Once this has finished, run 'yarn run dev' to start the project in developer mode.
6. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
